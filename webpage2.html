<p>Academically, I really enjoy the sciences, especially biology, physics, and computer science. I’ve always found science to be extremely intriguing and something that I would like to learn more and more about. I like reading magazines and newspapers, especially on the science section of the New York Times. It’s always interesting to learn about new discoveries and happenings in the field of biology. Over the summer, I read The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History (a book about how Earth is currently suffering from a man-made extinction through our negative impact on the environment) and The Emperor of All Maladies (a memoir of Dr. Mukherjee’s experiences as a hematology/oncology fellow as well as a history of cancer treatment and research. The second book especially inspired me to go into medicine and research one day and create a new technology, medicine, or treatment that could potentially help the advancement of science and medicine.
In terms of grades, I tend to do better in humanities subjects: social studies, english, and spanish. I just love taking challenging courses that are interesting to me, and I think this disparity in terms of grades is due to Stuyvesant STEM classes being more difficult than humanities classes for the average student. I don’t have an intended major as of yet, but I am considering computer science or biology.
